21 Creative Accent Wall Ideas for Trendy Kids’ Bedrooms From decoist.com</p>
<p>Consider placing your bed lengthwise along the center of the wall, leaving the head of the bed open. In bedrooms, there are limited ways to place something as big as a mastress, and in many situations, placing your bed in front of a window just works best. A murphy bed that folds away during the day is also a smart option for a small bedroom setup. However, using the wall over the bed to create a display can be hugely effective, especially in a space that has little architectural interest or, indeed, space.</p>

Place the bed under one window and keep the other free from any other obstruction to flush the room with freshness and brightness. Instead, put the bed against the corner. On top of it, a lampshade table light is placed. The truth is you are creating another problem.
